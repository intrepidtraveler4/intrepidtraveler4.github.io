<h2 id="Who-am-I">Who am I</h2>

<p> My name is Nicholas Schwarzbeck and I am 15 years old. I have spent my summers since I was 3 months old living at Hecate Cove. For the past 6 years I have hiked and kayaked all over Nootka Island. Additionally I have hiked in Peru, Chile, Vancouver Island, Seattle and Mexico. To name a few of the hikes I have completed, the Elk River Trail near Campbell River (26km), Nootka Trail (), and the Torres del Paine W trek (100km). From my experiences, I have a vast knowledge of Nootka Island.  </p>

    <h2 id="Outdoor-Experience">Outdoor Experience</h2>
    <p>The outdoor experience of Camp Hecate Cove is a very unique experience. Camp Hecate Cove is located on the very remote eastern part of Nootka Island. Our property on Hecate Cove doesn't have any internet and the only communication that we have around the island is vhf radio, so we are completely disconnected from the outside world. We get our water from a waterfall, which is positioned between our boat's dock and our property. Our nearest neighbours on Nootka Island are positioned 30 minutes away from our property. Because our property is remote it enables us to teach campers about the wilderness in the wilderness and through unforgetable experiences.    </p>

<p>We believe that we need to give back to Canada because Canada is giving us the opportunity to educate the youth through outdoor activities. We are going to give 15% of our total profits to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.esperanzaministries.com/">Esperanza Mission </a>, a non profit mission located in Vancouver Island (Directly across from Hecate Cove )   </p>
